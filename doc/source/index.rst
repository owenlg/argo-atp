ATP Documentation
==========================================

This is the offcial source code documentation for SAM Aggregated Topology Provider (ATP). This component is responsible for aggregating grid topology information from different grid infrastructures (EGI, OSG), projects, VOs, sites, services and downtimes. The information gathered by ATP is then consumed by other SAM components.
